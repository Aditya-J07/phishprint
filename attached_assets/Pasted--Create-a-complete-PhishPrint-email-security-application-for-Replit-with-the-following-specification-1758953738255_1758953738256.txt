*Create a complete PhishPrint email security application for Replit with the following specifications:*

Build a Gmail-like email security suite called "PhishPrint" that combines phishing detection, code injection analysis, and interactive AI chat. Requirements:

*Technical Stack:* Python, Streamlit, scikit-learn (Isolation Forest), Plotly for visualizations

*Core Features:*
1. Gmail-style inbox interface showing 4 demo emails with color-coded risk indicators
2. Multi-threat detection engine analyzing both phishing patterns and code injection attempts  
3. Personalized behavioral analysis using Isolation Forest ML model trained on user communication patterns
4. Interactive chat assistant that answers questions about specific email threats
5. Real-time PhishScore calculation (0-100) with visual gauge display

*Demo Email Scenarios:*
- Normal work email (low risk, green indicator)
- Obvious phishing with urgent language and suspicious URLs (high risk, red)
- Sophisticated spear phishing from colleague asking for financial approval at unusual time (high risk, red)
- Newsletter with embedded JavaScript injection code (high risk, red)

*UI Requirements:*
- Gmail-like layout with email list on left, analysis panel on right
- Click email to see detailed security breakdown with flags and explanations
- Plotly gauge showing PhishScore with color-coded risk levels
- Chat input box where users can ask "Is this safe?" "Why this score?" "What's suspicious?"
- Professional styling with risk indicators (red/orange/green borders)

*Detection Logic:*
- Heuristic analysis: suspicious keywords, URL patterns, sender verification
- ML anomaly detection: learns normal communication timing, length, sender patterns
- Code injection scanning: regex patterns for script tags, eval(), encoded payloads
- Combined scoring system with explanatory flags for transparency

*File Structure for Replit:*
- main.py (Streamlit runner configured for Replit)
- app.py (complete application code)
- requirements.txt (all dependencies)
- .replit and replit.nix (configuration files)

Make it hackathon-ready with instant deployment, professional appearance, and compelling demo flow showing escalating threat detection capabilities. Focus on the personalized behavioral analysis as the key differentiator from generic email filters.




Image explained-:
The images show:
- Gmail-like inbox interface with color-coded risk indicators
- PhishScore display (7.5 'Moderate' shown)
- Interactive chat overlay for asking questions about emails
- Professional integration into existing email workflow

Build exactly what these screenshots demonstrate - a seamless security layer that doesn't disrupt the familiar Gmail experience."

*Why Images Help:*
- AI understands your exact vision instead of guessing
- Gets the color scheme and layout proportions right
- Sees the chat overlay positioning and styling
- Understands the professional, integrated approach vs standalone tool

*What to Include with Images:*
- Brief description of each screenshot's purpose
- Specific UI elements you want replicated
- The chat interaction flow you're envisioning

The visual reference will produce much more accurate code that matches your hackathon presentation needs. Without images, the AI might create a generic security dashboard instead of the Gmail-integrated assistant you're planning.
